We created ASP.NET core mvc web application.
We made class that called calculator and interface that contain the "Add" method, the class use this interface.
In Startup we made the Dependency-Injection that if the controller constructor get the Calculator object it will create from the Startup.
In addisonal we added swagger to the project that will run the client when the project is running.
To test our controller you can run the project and use the swagger to check the api.
